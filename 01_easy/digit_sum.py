# Write a function called digit_sum that takes a positive integer n as input
# and returns the sum of all that numberâ€™s digits. 

# For example: digit_sum(1234) should return 10 which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4. 
# (Assume that the number you are given will always be positive.)

def digit_sum(n):
  total = 0
  string_n = str(n)
  for char in string_n:
    total += int(char)
  return total

print digit_sum(1234)
